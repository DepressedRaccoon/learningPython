# learningPython
This is a list of many labs and projects I have completed as part of the Intro Courses @ JCCC. By no means is this a complete listing of all assignments completed during the course.  

## Assignment List

### Labs
- Lab 6.1: Write a program that will prompt the user for a number and display "Positive" if the number is greater than zero, "Negative" if it is less than zero, or "Zero" if it is zero.
- Lab 6.2: Write a program that will prompt the user for 3 numbers, then display the largest of the 3. 
- Lab 6.4: Write a program that will prompt the user to enter the lengths of three line segments and determine if they can form a valid triangle.
- Lab 6.4-sort: Write a program that will prompt the user to enter the lengths of three line segments and determine if they can form a valid triangle. This version takes in any array of lengths and displays all valid triangle combinations using a bucket sort. 
- Lab 6.5: Complete the simple calculator program that will allow the user to enter a number, an operator, and another number. It will then calculate the result of applying the operators to the number and display the result. The valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- Lab 7.2: Create a program that uses a while loop to read in a series of grades until the user enters a negative number, then displays the average of all numbers entered.
- Lab 7.4: Write a program that prompts the user for a minimum age and a maximum age. Then prompt the user for their age, and continue to do so until they enter an age not less than the minimum they supplied, and not more than the maximum they supplied. For each time they enter an invalid age for their age, display `"Sorry, invalid age entered."`
- Lab 7.5: Write a program that prompts the user for an integer, then uses a `for loop` to display the square of each number from 1 through the user's input. 
- Lab 7.7: Write a program that allows the user to input a starting value, then uses a `for loop` to display a countdown of even numbers from that starting value down to 2. If the user enters an odd starting value, the countdown should start at 1 less. For instance, if they enter 13, the first number displayed should be 12. If the user enters a number less than 2, no output should be
shown.
- Lab 7.8: Write a program will prompt the user for a number of rows and columns, then using nested for loops display a simple grid of numbers for the user.
- Lab 8.1: Write a program that prompts the user for a floating-point number and displays the following.
    - The ceiling of the number.
    - The floor of the number.
    - If the number is negative or zero, its absolute value.
    - If the number is positive, the negation of the number.
    - If the number is greater than zero, the square root of the number with exactly 3 digits after the decimal point.

### Projects
- Project 1: yYu will build a system to allow a user to determine the price for a service/item. Your program should allow the user to choose options for three different categories.  Based on the user choices, your program should calculate the total cost of the product/service and display the total cost of the product, including a breakdown of the choices selected.
